# Project Agent Instructions (Auto-Loaded)

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid duplication.

Source of truth: `AGENTS.md`
- Conventions, workflow, and handoff rules live there.
- Read `TODO_NEXT.md` for immediate next actions.
- Use `ROADMAP.md` for work items and parallel execution.
- Use `PROGRESS.md` for deep dive context.
