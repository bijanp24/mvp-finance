- Agent: Interactive CLI Agent
- Status: Completed
- Branch: wi/p7-visual-polish
- Commit: pending
- Scope: Address user feedback: Dark theme, account name truncation, and chart aesthetics.
- Changes:
  - **WI-P6-008 (Dark Theme)**:
    - Updated `styles.scss` with a sleek dark slate/blue palette.
    - Switched Material theme to `mat.m2-define-dark-theme`.
    - Adjusted global background gradients for dark mode.
  - **WI-P6-009 (Account Name Truncation)**:
    - Updated `accounts.scss` to use `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `max-width` for account names on cards.
    - Made `AccountDialogComponent` more responsive by replacing `min-width` with a responsive `width` and `max-width`.

    - Enhanced all chart components (`debt`, `investment`, `net-worth`) with dark mode colors and grid lines.
    - Enabled `smooth: true` consistently and hidden series symbols (`showSymbol: false`) to reduce noise.
    - Improved area gradients for a modern look in dark mode.
- Tests: Production build successful.
- Decisions:
  - Opted for a "slate" dark theme (#0f172a) instead of pure black for better readability and a more professional feel.
  - Reduced series symbols on charts to make trends more apparent without jagged "discrete moment" visual noise.

    - `test`: jest
    - `test:watch`: jest --watch
    - `test:coverage`: jest --coverage
  - Created `dashboard/src/app/app.spec.ts`:
    - Smoke test suite with 2 tests
    - Verifies Jest runs and jest-dom matchers work
- Implementation details:
  - Used --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve Angular 21 peer dependency conflicts
  - Minimal setup-jest.ts (no preset import needed, handled by config)
  - Explicit transform configuration for jest-preset-angular
  - TypeScript compiler warnings about isolatedModules/emitDecoratorMetadata are expected
- Tests: 2 passing (Jest Setup suite)
- Verification: `cd dashboard; npm test` - SUCCESS
- Decisions:

## 2025-12-23 (WI-P2-003 & WI-P2-004: Crossover Milestone Calculation)
- Agent: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)
- Status: Completed
- Branch: master
- Commit: pending
- Scope: Phase 2 - Calculate and display when investment returns exceed debt interest
- Changes:
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/core/services/projection.service.ts`:
    - Added computed signal: `crossoverDate` (lines 93-152)
    - Calculates monthly investment returns vs monthly debt interest
    - Uses 18% default APR for debt interest calculation
    - Returns ISO date string when crossover found, null otherwise
    - Handles edge cases: no debt, no investments, never reached
    - Fixed parameter order in `buildDebtSimulationRequest()` (extraPayment before settings)
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/pages/projections/projections.ts`:
    - Added signal: `readonly crossoverDate = this.projectionService.crossoverDate` (line 39)
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/pages/projections/projections.html`:
    - Added milestone card between header and debt projection (after line 18)
    - Conditionally displayed with `@if (crossoverDate())`
    - Shows formatted date and user-friendly description
    - Uses non-null assertion operator for formatDate call
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/pages/projections/projections.scss`:
    - Added `.milestone-card` styling with purple gradient background
    - Large centered date display (2rem font)
    - White text with high contrast

    - Added MatSnackBar import and injection
    - Added MatSnackBarModule to imports array
    - Fixes error handling in save operation
- Implementation details:
  - Crossover algorithm:
    1. Validates both debt and investment projections exist
    2. Checks edge cases (no debt, no investments)
    3. Calculates weighted average APR (defaults to 18%)
    4. Iterates through months comparing returns vs interest
    5. Returns first month where investment return > debt interest
  - Monthly investment return = current value - previous value
  - Monthly debt interest = total debt * (APR / 12)
  - Date alignment handled via Map for efficient lookup
- Tests: Build passed successfully
- Verification: `cd dashboard; npm run build` - SUCCESS
- Decisions:
  - Used 18% default APR (typical credit card rate) since per-debt APR not in snapshots
  - Combined WI-P2-003 and WI-P2-004 (calculation + UI) in single implementation
  - Dashboard display deferred (only on projections page for now)
  - Purple gradient chosen for visual impact and differentiation
  - Fixed parameter order issue (extraPayment before settings) for consistency
- Known issues:
  - Bundle size warning (594.65 kB vs 500 kB budget) - not introduced by this change
- Next steps:
  - Manual testing: create accounts with both debt and investments
  - Verify crossover date calculation is reasonable
  - Test edge cases: only debt, only investments, different time ranges
  - Consider adding crossover milestone to dashboard page

## 2025-12-23 (WI-P2-001 & WI-P2-002: Scenario Slider for Extra Debt Payments)
- Agent: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)
- Status: Completed
- Branch: master
- Commit: pending
- Scope: Phase 2 - Interactive scenario slider for debt payoff optimization

    - Added signals: `extraPayment`, `debtProjectionWithExtra`
    - Added computed: `debtComparison` (calculates months saved, interest saved)
    - Added method: `onExtraPaymentChange()` to recalculate with extra payment
    - Updated `onTimeRangeChange()` to recalculate extra payment scenario
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/pages/projections/projections.html`:
    - Added Material slider (0-500 range, $25 steps) with ngModel binding
    - Added comparison stats display (new payoff date, months saved, interest saved)
    - Conditionally shown only when debt accounts exist
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/pages/projections/projections.scss`:
    - Added `.extra-payment-slider` styling with light background
    - Added `.comparison-stats` grid layout with highlighted green values
  - Modified `dashboard/src/app/core/services/projection.service.ts`:
    - Added method: `calculateDebtProjectionWithExtra()` for scenario calculation
    - Modified: `buildDebtSimulationRequest()` to accept optional `extraPayment` parameter
    - Extra payment distributed equally across all debt accounts
- Implementation details:
  - Uses existing simulation endpoint (no backend changes needed)
  - Slider defaults to $0 (baseline scenario)
  - Comparison shows: new debt-free date, months saved, interest saved
  - Extra payment split evenly across all debts (simple MVP approach)
  - Graceful handling: slider hidden when no debt accounts exist
- Tests: Build passed successfully
- Verification: `cd dashboard; npm run build` - SUCCESS (bundle size warning is expected)
- Decisions:
  - Used simulation endpoint instead of debt allocation endpoint (provides full payoff projection)
  - Equal distribution of extra payment (future: could use avalanche/snowball strategy)
  - Comparison stats highlighted in green to emphasize savings
  - No debouncing implemented (acceptable for MVP, could add 300ms delay later)
- Next steps:
  - Manual testing: verify slider updates comparison in real-time
  - Test with multiple debt accounts to verify equal distribution
  - Consider WI-P2-003 (Crossover Milestone) or WI-P2-004 next

  - Includes horizontal $0 reference line
  - Handles edge cases: only debt, only investments, or neither
  - Shows current and projected net worth in summary stats
- Tests: Build passed successfully
- Verification: `cd dashboard; npm run build` - SUCCESS
- Decisions:
  - Used ECharts markLine for $0 reference line
  - Chart height 600px to match other projection charts
  - Empty state message when no accounts exist
- Next steps:
  - Manual testing: verify chart displays correctly with various account combinations
  - Consider WI-P2-001 (Scenario Slider) or WI-P2-003 (Crossover Milestone) next
